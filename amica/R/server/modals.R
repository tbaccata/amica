      "enriched" to retrieve differentially abundant proteins against the control.

      When you hover over the volcano - or MA - plot you can see features to

      annotate the highest enriched proteins, as seen in the figure above.

      Further information on most plots can be acquired when you press the "info"

      the comma-delimited gene names into a text editor (or text processing tool

  <h3>What to report</h3>
  <p>Please report all analysis parameters in the "Input tab" used for data 
analysis, that are available for download after data upload and which are 
also depicted in the QC report:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Filtering proteins on MS/MS counts and min. razor peptides</li>
	<li>Filtering proteins on min. valid values per group</li>
	<li>Normalization settings</li>
	<li>Imputation settings</li>
</ul>



<p>Please also make sure to save the selected global parameters used for 
quantification in the "Differential abundance tab", which are also 
available in the Differential Abundance report:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Fold change threshold</li>
	<li>Significance cutoff (adj. p-value, p-value or none)</li>
	<li>(adj.) p-value threshold</li>
	<li>How to apply fold change threshold (absolute, show only 
	enriched, or show only reduced)</li>
</ul>
